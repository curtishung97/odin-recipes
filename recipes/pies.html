    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>800g Gravy Beef, cut into 2cm pieces</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 brown onions, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, peeled, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>3 celery sticks, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 bacon rashers, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>440ml can Guinness Draught beer</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml) beef stock</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sheets frozen shortcrust pastry, just thawed</li>
            <li>1 Free Range Egg, lightly whisked</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 140&deg;C. Place the beef in a large bowl. Sprinkle with flour. Season. Toss to lightly coat the beef.</li>
            <li>Heat half the oil in a large flameproof casserole pan over medium-high heat. Add one-third of the beef and cook, turning occasionally, for 5 mins or until brown all over. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Repeat in 2 more batches with the remaining beef.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in the pan. Add onion, carrot, celery, bacon and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until onion softens. Return the beef to the pan with the beer, stock, tomato paste, rosemary and bay leaves. Bring to the boil. Cover and bake, stirring occasionally, for 2 1/2 hours or until beef is very tender. Season to taste. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Divide mixture evenly among four 1 1/2-cup (375ml) ramekins or ovenproof dishes. Use an 11cm round pastry cutter to cut 8 discs from the pastry, reserving excess pastry. Brush half the pastry discs with a little egg. Top with the remaining discs to make a stack. Brush with a little more egg. Use a 1cm star-shaped pastry cutter to cut stars from the excess pastry. Arrange over the discs and brush with egg. Top each ramekin with a pastry disc. Place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 mins or until the pastry is golden brown and puffed and the filling is heated through.</li>
