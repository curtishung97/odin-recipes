    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whether you're trying to survive the summer heat (like all of us in Texas), need to cool down after a workout or just want a natural, refreshing treat from nature, then my 4-ingredient frozen fruit sorbet recipe is for you.</p>

    <p>And the best thing - you don't need an ice cream maker for this homemade fruit sorbet - just a food processor or a hi-powered blender (and a little patience to get it just right).  You can mix and match the fruit flavors to your liking - so you can make a lemon sorbet inspired treat, strawberries, and banana or one of my personal favorites, mango, pineapple, watermelon sorbet and raspberry sorbet!</p>
        
    <p>This is a delicious frozen dessert that you and your family are sure to love.  And it's a great way to get kids (and some adults) to eat more of nature's candy! Enjoy our easy fruit sorbet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups frozen fruit</li>
            <li>1/2 <strong><em>ripe</em></strong> avacado</li>
            <li>Juice from 1 lime</li>
            <li>Your favourite (calorie-conscious) toppings (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>For best results, place the food processor bin and blade in the freezer for at least 1 hour prior to using.  Add the frozen fruit, avocado and lime to the food processor and blend.  You may need to stop the blending and use a spatula to mix and mash the ingredients down so that it continues to blend.  As it becomes more smooth, add the agave (and/or more lime juice) as it blends.  Stop when it is a thick texture like mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy immediately or place in a foil tin (or air tight container) in the freezer.  If you freeze it, allow the sorbet to thaw for 10-20 minutes at room temperature prior to enjoying so it is softens some.</li>
            <li>Add your favourite toppings and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
